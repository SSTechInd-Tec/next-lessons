            We Butter the Bread with Butter was founded in 2007 by Marcel
            Neumann, who was originally guitarist for Martin Kesici's band, and
            Tobias Schultka. The band was originally meant as a joke, but
            progressed into being a more serious musical duo. The name for the
            band has no particular meaning, although its origins were suggested
            from when the two original members were driving in a car operated by
            Marcel Neumann and an accident almost occurred. Neumann found
            Schultka "so funny that he briefly lost control of the vehicle."
            Many of their songs from this point were covers of German folk tales
            and nursery rhymes.
